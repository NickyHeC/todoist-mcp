# mcp-template

A starter template for building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers with the [dedalus_mcp](https://docs.dedaluslabs.ai/dmcp) framework. Authentication is handled by **DAuth** (Dedalus Auth).

This template supports three auth frameworks — **No Auth**, **API Key**, and **OAuth**. Each has its own `src-*` folder with a complete, ready-to-run server. You can either use the **CLI** to scaffold a new project automatically, or **clone this repo** and rename a folder manually.

## What is DAuth?

[DAuth](https://www.dedaluslabs.ai/blog/dedalus-auth-launch) is a multi-tenant authentication layer for MCP servers built by Dedalus Labs. It solves a core problem in the MCP ecosystem: most servers require API keys or tokens, but the MCP spec doesn't define how non-OAuth credentials should be handled securely. Without DAuth, developers either build their own auth infrastructure or pass raw secrets around — both are bad options.

DAuth is **zero-trust** and **host-blind** — Dedalus never sees your raw API keys. Here's how it works:

1. The SDK **encrypts credentials client-side** before they leave your device.
2. When a request reaches your MCP server, it acts as a standard **OAuth 2.1 Resource Server** — access is verified without touching the credential.
3. Authenticated requests are forwarded to **the Enclave**, a network-isolated, hardware-secured execution environment written in Rust.
4. Inside the Enclave, the credential is **decrypted for milliseconds**, used to call the external API, then **zeroed from memory**.
5. Only the API **response** is returned — the raw secret is never exposed to your server code, to Dedalus, or to the network.

This means your MCP server only holds an opaque connection handle, never a raw key. DAuth is built into the `dedalus_mcp` SDK and works across all auth types (Bearer tokens, API keys, OAuth, etc.).

## Quick Start

### Option A: CLI (recommended)

Scaffold a new project with one command. The CLI prompts for your project name, auth type, and package manager, then generates a ready-to-run project with dependencies installed.

```bash
npx create-dmcp
```

Or pass the project name directly:

```bash
npx create-dmcp my-mcp-server
```

Requires Node.js >= 18. The generated project is pure Python.

### Option B: Clone and rename

Clone this repo and rename the `src-*` folder that matches your auth type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NickyHeC/mcp-template.git my-mcp-server
cd my-mcp-server
mv src-api-key src
rm -rf src-no-auth src-oauth
pip install -e .
```

└── README.md
```

Each `src-*` folder is a complete, self-contained server. If using the **CLI**, it copies the right template into `<project>/src/` automatically. If **cloning manually**, rename the folder you want:

```bash
mv src-api-key src           # rename your chosen template to src/
```

The server code expects to live in a folder called `src/` — all internal imports use `from src.tools import ...` and `from src.main import ...`. After renaming (or CLI scaffolding), the server is ready to configure and run.

## Choose Your Auth Framework

Pick the framework that matches your target platform's authentication method.

| Framework | When to use | Folder |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **No Auth** | Tools that don't call external APIs — calculators, formatters, local utilities | `src-no-auth/` |
| **API Key** | Platforms that use static credentials — API keys, personal access tokens, bot tokens (e.g. GitHub, Slack, Discord) | `src-api-key/` |
| **OAuth** | Platforms that require browser-based user authorization — OAuth 2.0 flows (e.g. Gmail, Linear, Spotify, Google Calendar) | `src-oauth/` |

### No Auth

Use when your tools are self-contained and don't need to call any external API.

- No `Connection` object needed
- No DAuth configuration
- No environment variables beyond basic server settings
- Tools are simple decorated functions

```python
from dedalus_mcp import MCPServer, tool

@tool(description="Add two numbers")
def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    return a + b

server = MCPServer("my-mcp")
server.collect(add)
```

**To use:** `mv src-no-auth src`

### API Key

Use when the platform authenticates with a static credential that the user provides once (API key, personal access token, bot token, etc.).

- `Connection` + `SecretKeys` declares the credential name
- DAuth encrypts and manages the credential in its enclave
- Tools can use `ctx.dispatch()` for authenticated requests, or call APIs directly
- Environment variables: `DEDALUS_AS_URL`, your platform's token

```python
from dedalus_mcp.auth import Connection, SecretKeys

platform_connection = Connection(
    name="github",
    secrets=SecretKeys(token="GITHUB_TOKEN"),
    base_url="https://api.github.com",
    auth_header_format="token {api_key}",
)
```

**To use:** `mv src-api-key src`

### OAuth

Use when the platform requires a browser-based OAuth flow where users authorize your application to act on their behalf.

- `Connection` + `SecretKeys` declares the token name (same as API Key from code perspective)
- The Dedalus platform handles the full OAuth token exchange externally
- OAuth configuration (client ID, client secret, authorize/token URLs, scopes) is set via environment variables
- **Important:** OAuth environment variables must be baked into the server when deploying to ensure the connection works
- Tools use `ctx.dispatch()` for authenticated requests through the DAuth enclave

```python
from dedalus_mcp.auth import Connection, SecretKeys

platform_connection = Connection(
    name="linear-mcp",
    secrets=SecretKeys(token="LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"),
    base_url="https://api.linear.app",
    auth_header_format="Bearer {api_key}",
)
```

> **Note on OAuth with DAuth:** Your Python server code looks nearly identical to the API Key template. The difference is that the Dedalus platform reads the `OAUTH_*` environment variables to orchestrate the browser-based OAuth flow and token refresh. Your server code never manages OAuth tokens directly — it just calls `ctx.dispatch()` and DAuth applies the token inside the enclave.

**To use:** `mv src-oauth src`

## How to Build an MCP Server from This Template

> If you used the CLI (`npx create-dmcp`), steps 2 is already done — the CLI chose the template, renamed it to `src/`, and installed dependencies. You still need to fill in `.env` (step 3) and configure the server (step 4).

### 1. Research the Target Platform API

Read the API docs for the platform you want to integrate. Note:

- Available endpoints and features
- Authentication method (Bearer token, API key, OAuth, etc.)
- Rate limits and restrictions
- Response formats

Save your notes in `PROJECT.md` — it serves as context for you and for AI coding agents in later steps. The file is pre-formatted with sections for all the information you'll need.

**Tip:** Once your `PROJECT.md` is filled in, you can hand the project off to an AI coding agent with a prompt like: *"Build my MCP server based on this template and the notes in PROJECT.md."* The agent can read the template files, your research notes, and this README to implement the full server with minimal back-and-forth.

### 2. Choose an Auth Framework and Rename the Folder

*Skip this step if you used the CLI — it already did this for you.*

Based on your research, pick the right auth framework from the table above. Rename the chosen folder to `src/` and remove the others:

```bash
# Example: using the OAuth template
mv src-oauth src
rm -rf src-no-auth src-api-key
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

*Skip `cp` if you used the CLI — `.env.example` is already in your project.*

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in only the variables for your chosen auth framework. See `.env.example` for which variables belong to which framework.

- **No Auth:** No environment variables needed.
- **API Key:** Set `DEDALUS_AS_URL` and your platform's token (e.g. `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
- **OAuth:** Set `DEDALUS_AS_URL`, `DEDALUS_API_KEY`, and all `OAUTH_*` variables. These must also be configured in the deployment environment.

### 4. Configure the Server (`src/main.py`)

Customize `main.py` with your platform's details:

1. **Connection name** — Change `"platform"` to your platform's identifier (e.g. `"github"`, `"linear"`, `"spotify"`).
2. **Secret key** — Update `SecretKeys(token="...")` to match your credential name. The API Key template uses `"API_TOKEN"`; the OAuth template uses `"ACCESS_TOKEN"`. Rename to match your platform (e.g. `"GITHUB_TOKEN"`, `"LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN"`).
3. **Base URL** — Set to the platform's API root (e.g. `"https://api.github.com"`).
4. **Auth header format** — Set how the credential is attached. Common formats: `"Bearer {api_key}"`, `"token {api_key}"`, `"Bot {api_key}"`.
5. **Server name** — Change `"my-mcp"` to something descriptive (e.g. `"github-mcp"`). The CLI does this automatically.

### 5. Implement Tools (`src/tools.py`)

Define the tools your server will expose:

1. **Result models** — Create Pydantic `BaseModel` subclasses for structured return values.
2. **Request helper** — For API Key and OAuth templates, use the `api_request()` helper (which wraps `ctx.dispatch()`) to make authenticated calls through DAuth.
3. **Tool functions** — Decorate functions with `@tool(description="...")`. Use type hints for parameters and return a Pydantic model.
4. **Tool registry** — Add every tool to the `tools` list at the bottom of the file.

The template files include example tools demonstrating each pattern.

### 6. Test Locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Test your connection first** (API Key and OAuth only). Before starting the server, verify that your `Connection` config and credentials actually work:

```bash
python -m src.client --test-connection
```

This uses `ConnectionTester` from `dedalus_mcp.testing` to make a real API call to your target platform — no running server needed. Edit the test path in `client.py` to match a lightweight endpoint from your platform (e.g. `/user` for GitHub, `/v1/me` for Spotify). If it prints `OK`, your connection is good.

> **OAuth note:** For local testing you need a valid access token in `.env`. Obtain one from the platform's OAuth playground or developer console. When deployed on Dedalus, DAuth handles the full OAuth flow automatically.

**Then start the server and test tools:**

```bash
python -m src.main
```

The server starts on port 8080. Use the client to verify your tools:

```bash
python -m src.client
```

Update `src/client.py` to call your tools by name with the correct arguments.

### 7. Document Your Project

Update this README with:

- What your server does
- Available tools and their parameters
- Configuration and environment variables
- Usage examples

### 8. Clean Up Template Scaffolding

Once your server is built and working, remove leftover template files so the repo only contains your project code. If you're using an AI coding agent, ask it to perform this cleanup as a final step.

**Files to remove:**
- `PROJECT.md` — your research notes; no longer needed in the final repo
- Any remaining `src-*` folders (e.g. `src-no-auth/`, `src-api-key/`, `src-oauth/`) that weren't chosen
- `cli/`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` — CLI scaffolding tools, not part of your server
- `.env.example` — once your `.env` is set up (optional, some teams keep this for onboarding)

**Files to clean up:**
- `src/tools.py` — remove `ExampleResult` and `example_tool`; only your real tools should remain
- `src/client.py` — update to call your actual tools with real arguments, or remove if not needed
- `src/main.py` — remove the placeholder inline comments (e.g. `# A short identifier for this connection...`) once the values are filled in
- `README.md` — replace the template guide with project-specific documentation (see step 7)
- `pyproject.toml` — update the project `name` and `description` to match your server

### 9. Deploy to Dedalus Labs

Upload your server to [dedaluslabs.ai](https://dedaluslabs.ai). DAuth handles credential security automatically in production.

**Important for OAuth servers:** Make sure all `OAUTH_*` environment variables are configured in the deployment environment. These variables are consumed by the Dedalus platform to handle the OAuth flow — they must be baked into the server at deploy time.

---

## Making Authenticated API Calls with `ctx.dispatch()`

For API Key and OAuth servers, use `ctx.dispatch()` to make authenticated requests through DAuth. The framework applies the credential inside the enclave so your code never touches raw secrets.

```python
from dedalus_mcp import tool, get_context, HttpMethod, HttpRequest
from src.main import platform_connection

@tool(description="Fetch user profile")
async def get_profile() -> dict:
    ctx = get_context()
    req = HttpRequest(method=HttpMethod.GET, path="/user/profile")
    resp = await ctx.dispatch(platform_connection, req)
    if resp.success and resp.response is not None:
        return {"success": True, "data": resp.response.body}
    error = resp.error.message if resp.error else "Request failed"
    return {"success": False, "error": error}
```

The `path` is appended to the `base_url` configured in your `Connection` object. DAuth attaches the credential to the request using the `auth_header_format` you specified.
